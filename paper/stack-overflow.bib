	abstract = {Version control and bug tracking systems contain large amounts of historical information that can give deep insight into the evolution of a software project. Unfortunately, these systems provide only insufficient support for a detailed analysis of software evolution aspects. We address this problem and introduce an approach for populating a release history database that combines version data with bug tracking data and adds missing data not covered by version control systems such as merge points. Then simple queries can be applied to the structured data to obtain meaningful views showing the evolution of a software project. Such views enable more accurate reasoning of evolutionary aspects and facilitate the anticipation of software evolution. We demonstrate our approach on the large open source project Mozilla that offers great opportunities to compare results and validate our approach.},

The taxonomy is demonstrated to be expressive (i.e., capable of representing a wide spectrum of {MSR} investigations) and effective (i.e., facilitates similarities and comparisons of {MSR} investigations).

The mining software repositories ({MSR}) field analyzes and cross-links the rich data available in these repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems. By transforming these repositories from static record-keeping ones into active repositories, we can guide decision processes in modern software projects. For example, data in source control repositories, traditionally used to archive code, could be linked with data in bug repositories to help practitioners propagate complex changes and to warn them about risky code based on prior changes and bugs. In this paper, we present a brief history of the {MSR} field and discuss several recent achievements and results of using {MSR} techniques to support software research and practice. We then discuss the various opportunities and challenges that lie in the road ahead for this important and emerging field.},

Decentralization comes with both the promise of new data and the peril of its misinterpretation. We focus on git, a very popular {DSCM} used in high-profile projects. Decentralization, and other features of git, such as automatically recorded contributor attribution, lead to richer content histories, giving rise to new questions such as {ldquoHow} do contributions flow between developers to the official project repository?rdquo However, there are pitfalls. Commits may be reordered, deleted, or edited as they move between repositories. The semantics of terms common to {SCMs} and {DSCMs} sometimes differ markedly, potentially creating confusion. For example, a commit is immediately visible to all developers in centralized {SCMs}, but not in {DSCMs}. Our goal is to help researchers interested in {DSCMs} avoid these and other perils when mining and analyzing git data.},

However, so far there have been no studies describing the quality and properties of the data available from {GitHub}. We document the results of an empirical study aimed at understanding the characteristics of the repositories in {GitHub} and how users take advantage of {GitHub}'s main features---namely commits, pull requests, and issues. Our results indicate that, while {GitHub} is a rich source of data on software development, mining {GitHub} for research purposes should take various potential perils into consideration. We show, for example, that the majority of the projects are personal and inactive; that {GitHub} is also being used for free storage and as a Web hosting service; and that almost 40\% of all pull requests do not appear as merged, even though they were. We provide a set of recommendations for software engineering researchers on how to approach the data in {GitHub}.},

When it comes to software repositories collaboration is a rather ephemeral phenomenon which lacks a clear definition, and it must therefore be mined and modeled. This throws up the question whether what is mined actually maps to reality.   In this paper we investigate collaboration by modeling it using a number of diverse approaches that we then compare to a ground truth obtained by surveying a substantial set of developers of the Pharo open-source community. Our findings indicate that the notion of collaboration must be revisited, as it is undermined by a number of factors that are often tackled in imprecise ways or not taken into account at all.},

Our results show that projects developed in Java tend to have more negative commit comments, and that projects that have more distributed teams tend to have a higher positive polarity in their emotional content. Additionally, we found that commit comments written on Mondays tend to a more negative emotion.

In this position paper, we advocate Software Intelligence ({SI}) as the future of mining software engineering data, within modern software engineering research, practice, and education. We coin the name {SI} as an inspiration from the Business Intelligence ({BI}) field, which offers concepts and techniques to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems. Similarly, {SI} offers software practitioners (not just developers) up-to-date and pertinent information to support their daily decision-making processes. {SI} should support decision-making processes throughout the lifetime of a software system not just during its development phase. The vision of {SI} has yet to become a reality that would enable software engineering research to have a strong impact on modern software practice. Nevertheless, recent advances in the Mining Software Repositories ({MSR}) field show great promise and provide strong support for realizing {SI} in the near future. This position paper summarizes the state of practice and research of {SI}, and lays out future research directions for mining software engineering data to enable {SI}.},

This implicit price can be substantially raised by making prison sentences longer, but only if offenders' discount rates are relatively low.

We exploit the fact that young offenders are legally treated as adults–and face longer lengths of incarceration–the day they turn 18. Sufficiently patient individuals should therefore significantly lower their offending rates immediately upon turning 18. The small behavioral responses that we estimate suggest that potential offenders are extremely impatient, myopic, or both.},

We look at the effect of one badge in context on an individual user level and at the global scope of three related badges across all users by mining user behaviour around the time that the badge is awarded.

Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},
