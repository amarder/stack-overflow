Why are these results important? What are their implications? Why am I
revisiting the results of Grant and Betts? I think framing this paper
in the context of the 2x2 matrix will make things stronger.

I think the 95% confidence interval may get at what this reviewer is
looking for.

Flesh out discussion of methods and results.
