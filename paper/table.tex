    \begin{tablenotes}
    \mynote The six badges considered in this paper were introduced to the Stack Overflow site at different times. The \textit{Strunk \& White} badge was first awarded on September 15, 2008, while the three badges for asking questions were all introduced on July 2, 2014. Since the badges for asking questions were added to the site so recently many users who have been awarded these badges earned them for actions taken before the badge was introduced. For instance, 86\% of users who earned the \textit{Curious} badge were awarded the badge for actions taken before July 2, 2014. I drop these users from the analysis as they have no incentive to change their behavior to earn the \textit{Curious} badge. The three badges awarded for editing and answering multiple questions were introduced to Stack Overflow after September 14, 2014 and are not included in the Stack Exchange Data Dump updated on September 26, 2014.
