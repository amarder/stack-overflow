I am excited to present my paper, [Stack Overflow Badges and User Behavior: An Econometric Approach](https://github.com/amarder/stack-overflow/raw/msr2015-final/paper/stack-overflow.pdf), at the [12th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories](http://2015.msrconf.org/index.php) on May 16, 2015!

# Stack Overflow badges and user behavior

My current aim is to write a new paper identifying the causal effects of badges on user behavior. I want to write a paper that economists will enjoy reading. If I could publish the paper in [Labour Economics](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/labour-economics/) that would be amazing.

The current draft of the paper is available [here](https://github.com/amarder/stack-overflow/raw/master/paper/stack-overflow.pdf). Comments and questions are welcome.

# Reproducibility

If you are interested in reproducing the results, here's how I compile the paper:

    make figures/badges.pdf
    make paper/stack-overflow.pdf
