# Gamification of Stack Overflow

I aim to submit this report to the [MSR 2015 Mining Challenge](http://2015.msrconf.org/challenge.php). Download the current draft of the report [here](https://github.com/amarder/stack-overflow/raw/master/stack-overflow.pdf). Comments and questions are welcome!

If you want to play around with this project, here is how I compile the report using the included test data:

    make DATA_FOLDER=test-data stack-overflow.pdf
