# Stack Overflow badges and user behavior

I am excited to present my paper, [Stack Overflow Badges and User Behavior: An Econometric Approach][paper], at the [12th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories][msrconf] on May 16, 2015!

I am writing a new paper that aims to identify the causal effects of badges on user behavior. The paper is targeted for publication in [Labour Economics][labour-economics]. The current draft of the paper is available [here][draft]. Comments and questions are welcome.
