# Introduction

@deterding_game_2011 define "_gamification_ as the use of game design
elements in non-game contexts."
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a question and answer
website designed for programmers. Stack Overflow is gamified as
follows:

1. A user earns reputation points when another user votes on her posts
   (5 points when a questions is voted up, 10 points when an answer is
   voted up, 15 points when an answer is accepted, and 2 points when
   an edit is approved).

2. As a user earns reputation points she unlocks privileges on the
   site. For instance, a user must have at least 15 reputation points
   to vote up a question or answer. A list of all privileges is
   available [here](http://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges).

3. Users are awarded badges for special achievements. One receives the
   "Informed" badge by reading the entire
   [tour page](http://stackoverflow.com/tour). A list of badges is
   available [here](http://stackoverflow.com/help/badges).

@grant_encouraging_2013 present empirical evidence that three of the
badges awarded for various editing accomplishments are effective in
encouraging users to make more edits in the two months preceding
receipt of the badge compared to the two months after receiving the
badge. This paper aims to build upon the contributions of
@grant_encouraging_2013 by:

1. Using regression discontinuity to measure the causal impact of
   badges on user activity (questions, answers, and edits).[^RDD]

2. Applying the same methodology to measure the causal impact of
   privileges on user activity.

3. Comparing the estimated effects of badges and privileges will help
   us understand which components of Stack Overflow's gamification are
   most effective at promoting user engagement.

[^RDD]: @lee_regression_2010 provide an excellent guide for applying
regression discontinuity designs in empirical research.
